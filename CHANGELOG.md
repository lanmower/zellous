## [2026-08-20] Repo-sync: push unlanded commits, regenerate stale lockfile, revert a self-inflicted regression

- `chore(gm): track PRD/mutables state for repo-sync session` + 3 prior unpushed commits (67182d9..1961c9f) — local `main` was 4 commits ahead of `origin/main`, entirely unpushed since 2026-08-18. Pushed to sync.
- `chore(deps): regenerate stale package-lock.json (anentrypoint-design 0.0.484 -> 1.0.34)` (1961c9f) — the tracked lockfile had drifted ~6 months behind npm's real `latest` for `anentrypoint-design`. This was also the root cause of GitHub reporting 8 Dependabot alerts (`ws`/`qs`/`picomatch`/`path-to-regexp`/`minimatch`); confirmed none of those packages exist anywhere in the freshly-regenerated lockfile tree — a stale/lagging scan, not a real vulnerability, matching this repo's own documented 2026-08-06 precedent of the same phantom-alert pattern.
- `fix(deps): restore anentrypoint-design's floating 'latest' range` (cfd39e2) — the lockfile regen above had npm silently rewrite `package.json`'s deliberate `"latest"` range to a caret pin (`^1.0.34`) as an unrequested side effect of `npm install <pkg>@latest --package-lock-only`. Caught and reverted same session: `"latest"` is intentional here per this repo's own history (a caret on a 0.x line freezes rather than floats), and the whole point of this Node-side-only dependency (used by `site/theme.mjs` at flatspace build time) is to auto-track the SDK's newest publish.
- Verified both CDN-consumed sibling repos (`wireweave`, `anentrypoint-design`) live and healthy via their jsdelivr `/gh/main` endpoints — no importmap changes needed, confirming the architecture documented in AGENTS.md is intact.
- Mid-session the shared `gm` plugkit daemon broke repo-wide (host-runner/plugin ABI mismatch after a version swap: runner moved to 0.1.84, plugin stayed pinned to 0.1.1236 briefly) — fell back to direct `git`/`gh` CLI for the affected window, same discipline and witness standard, matching this repo's own documented precedent for daemon outages (2026-07-26/07-28 entries). Daemon self-recovered later in the session.

## [2026-08-06] Perfection pass: critical voice crash fix, GH Pages deploy race, branch consolidation

- `fix(voice): add setAudioConstraints/setForceRelay, enforce bans on already-connected peers` (40368f2, sibling `wireweave` repo, published npm 0.3.64) — `VoiceSession` never actually defined `setAudioConstraints()` despite the consumer calling it on every voice `connect()`; every voice join in production threw `TypeError` immediately regardless of mic permission state. This was the highest-impact defect found this session. Also added `setForceRelay()` (Force-TURN setting had zero protocol-layer effect) and live ban/timeout/kick enforcement against already-open peer connections, not just future connection attempts — `kickFromVoice()` was previously a complete no-op.
- `fix(voice+security): wire force-relay/bitrate settings live, fix XSS gap in channel type label` (5716392) — Voice Settings modal's force-TURN/bitrate controls updated localStorage/UI state but never called into the actual voice session; wired both through. Escaped an unescaped `ch.type` fallback in the channel settings modal (a malicious server owner could publish an arbitrary channel-type string via a crafted kind:30078 event and land it unescaped in innerHTML).
- `ci: deploy GH Pages from main only, not main+master` (353885d) + `merge: consolidate master into main, master retired per single-branch policy` (08fdcbe) — `gh-pages.yml` triggered on both branches into the same deploy target with no tie-breaking beyond push order, so a stale `master` push could silently overwrite a newer `main` deploy (this is why the voice fix above initially failed to reach production despite CI passing). Merged master's 3 unique commits into main and deleted master.
- `chore: regenerate stale package-lock.json, clears 8 Dependabot alerts` (399b28a) — the tracked lockfile had only 10 package entries and was missing playwright's real transitive tree; the vulnerable `ws`/`qs`/`picomatch`/`path-to-regexp`/`minimatch` versions Dependabot flagged weren't actually resolved by current `npm install`. Regenerated to a real 19-package tree, 0 vulnerabilities.
- Full 3-agent parallel code audit (voice, XSS/security, moderation+chat+pages+forum) plus live browser witnessing against the deployed production URL confirmed the rest of the app — chat send/receive/deletion/reactions, Pages/Forum CRUD, moderation authorization, member list, all Nostr-event-sourced-field sanitization sinks except the one above — already correct.

## [2026-08-06] Cross-repo doc-accuracy + CI hardening audit across zellous, design, wireweave

- `docs: correct stale AGENTS.md claims, document docs->dist asset copy, add CI browser-witness job` (2100117) — AGENTS.md wrongly claimed 28 `sdk-*.js` mount files remained on disk unloaded; only `sdk-command-palette.js` remains and it is loaded. Documented how `docs/` reaches production (`gh-pages.yml` uploads `dist/`, and `site/theme.mjs`'s `assets` map copies `docs/nostr-chat` et al. into it verbatim at build time) and fixed `theme.mjs`'s comment that inaccurately described that copy as an iframe.
- `ci: bump node-version from 20 to 22` (8f434c1) + `ci: bump pinned actions past their Node20-runtime majors` (2080f26) — cleared the recurring "Node.js 20 is deprecated" annotation on every CI/deploy run; `checkout`/`setup-node`/`cache`/`configure-pages`/`upload-pages-artifact`/`deploy-pages` bumped to their latest majors, watched live against a real push to confirm the annotation is gone and nothing regressed.
- `wireweave test: cover createWireweave deps-guard and VoiceSession's synchronous API surface` (899aa00, sibling repo) — `Servers()` now throws 3 distinct per-field error messages instead of one generic one; `test.js` gained real coverage for `createWireweave`'s 3 dependency guards and for `VoiceSession`'s constructor guard + every live-settable setter, closing a real gap (the WebRTC voice-signaling module had zero test references at all).
- `design docs: fix 3 stale (unreleased) markers on already-shipped CHANGELOG entries` (735135d, sibling repo) — `anentrypoint-design`'s own CHANGELOG.md had version headers for 0.0.246/0.0.243/0.0.239 still marked "(unreleased)" despite real `chore(release)` commits shipping all three.

## [2026-07-30] 20-agent research+implementation fan-out: 6 fixes including one real functional bug and one XSS

- `fix(xss): escape untrusted Nostr event fields before innerHTML insertion` (cdd88d2) — server name/color tags from kind:34550 events were concatenated raw into innerHTML/style in the join-preview modal, edit-server-name input, and server-icon list; any user able to rename a server could inject markup into another viewer's client. Fixed via the existing `escHtml()` helper. Bundled with a keyboard-accessibility pass (focus-visible styles, keyboard activation on channel/server rail items, Escape-to-close on legacy overlays).
- `fix(adapter): implement uiMembers.categories() so the member list ever renders non-empty` (cdc8508) — the adapter's `memberCategories` computation called a method that was never defined, so the member list always rendered empty regardless of real online members.
- `fix(files): route generic file upload through existing Blossom path, remove dead legacy code` (a7673d8) — generic (non-image/video) file uploads previously hit a dead, always-failing legacy path even though a working Blossom-based upload mechanism already existed for images/video.
- `fix(wireweave-bridge): surface a clear boot-error message when wireweave import fails` (6437d5e) — matches the SDK import's existing graceful-failure messaging pattern; still hard-fails (no fallback mode), just with actionable feedback instead of a raw stack trace.
- `fix(wireweave): pin CDN import to caret range instead of fully unpinned` (e2ef5ce) — narrows blast radius to same-major regressions only, while keeping the zero-vendor/zero-build live-CDN architecture and its automatic patch/minor tracking.
- `ci: add advisory Playwright browser-witness job with chromium caching` (f9b654c) — CI now runs the full browser-witness validation loop step (appReady + zero console errors) as a non-blocking job, closing a gap this file had flagged as deferred.
- 10 parallel research agents also surveyed recent NIP proposals (NIP-25 reactions, NIP-7D forum threads, NIP-07/NIP-17 DM signer interop), WebRTC voice-quality successors to RNNoise, and CSP/SRI/import-map hardening options — captured as implementable specs in AGENTS.md's caveats for future sessions, not all implemented this session since several require sibling-repo (`wireweave`) protocol-layer changes outside this repo's write scope.

## [2026-07-30] wireweave now consumed live over CDN (esm.sh), matching the SDK's live-consumption pattern

- `feat(wireweave): consume live from npm via esm.sh, remove vendored copy` (f8a0174 zellous) — the hand-copied `docs/vendor/wireweave/src/` directory had drifted several npm releases stale (this session's re-vendor found it missing 3 files entirely and a whole constructor-options architecture). Switched to the same live-CDN pattern already used for the `anentrypoint-design` SDK: `wireweave-bridge.js` now imports the bare specifier `wireweave`, mapped in the importmap to the unpinned `https://esm.sh/wireweave` (always resolves latest). Eliminates the vendor-drift class of bug at the root instead of re-vendoring by hand again next time it happens.
- Also re-exercised a stale `blockedBy:external` mobile-viewport row from 2026-07-24 now that the original blocker (gm's own browser verb never spawning chromium) is confirmed fixed — zero regressions found at 375x667/667x375.

## [2026-07-30] 6-agent parallel audit + wireweave re-vendor: 9 defects fixed across zellous, wireweave, and the SDK

- `fix(voice,a11y,channels): re-vendor wireweave, wire real VAD, fix audit findings` (2a04694 zellous) — silent file-upload failures now toast; `#drawerOverlay` had zero CSS rules (same silent `body.scrollHeight` inflation class as `.video-playback`/`.settings-popover`), now `position:fixed`/`display:none`; a dark-theme `--bg-3` override broke the SDK's own 4.5:1 contrast guarantee, restored; several icon-only buttons gained `aria-label`; deleted the fully-dead legacy `docs/js/ptt.js` and a stale bare `ptt` reference that would have thrown post-delete; wired a real `'vad'` mode into `voice-ptt.js`.
- `fix(voice,channels,servers,roles): close authz/validation gaps, wire real VAD transmit` (1666767 wireweave) — an admin could demote another admin or the owner via `roles.setRole` with no owner check; `channels.create`/`rename` had no name validation in the data layer at all (empty/duplicate names could reach the published event); `channels.remove` could delete the last channel, orphaning the server; `servers.rename` had no empty-name guard. VAD auto-transmit was architecturally broken — the only speaker-activity analyzer ran on the same mute-gated track it needed to hear the user's own speech on to auto-unmute; fixed by cloning the raw track into an always-enabled local listen-tap independent of the transmit gate. Re-vendored the whole `docs/vendor/wireweave/src/` tree into zellous, which had drifted several releases behind (missing 3 files entirely, missing the `pttMode`/`micSensitivity`/audio-quality-tier/DTX constructor architecture).
- `fix(a11y): close the remaining focus-on-open races in 4 overlay primitives` (f31467c anentrypoint-design) — `FocusTrap`, `CommandPalette`'s search input, `RovingMenu`'s first-item focus, and `ApprovalPrompt`'s note textarea all still used `queueMicrotask` for focus-on-open, the same race already fixed in six other overlay types this repo tracks.
- `fix(voice): clip PTT glow halo instead of letting it bleed past the button` (1e8cdb4 anentrypoint-design) — `.vx-ptt-glow`'s `-4px` inset had no clip on its parent, bleeding 4px past the button on every axis at every viewport; a prior width-only media-query patch had only closed the horizontal half of the same bug. `overflow:hidden` on `.vx-ptt` clips it uniformly.

## [2026-07-28] Exhaustive GUI/mobile/voice audit: 5 real defects fixed across zellous + the SDK repo

- `feat(voice+channels): wire real channel-context menus, create-channel, voice settings modal; remove dead ui-chat.js` (cc92e38 zellous) — channel/server right-click menus were invisible (missing `.open` class on `_mkMenu`'s element); the rail had no way to create a channel at all until `anentrypoint-design`'s `community-app.js` gained a "+" affordance this session; the Voice Settings modal was entirely dead (`window.openVoiceSettings` was never defined anywhere, even though every backing signal already existed); deleted `docs/js/ui-chat.js`, confirmed fully unreachable (targeted a DOM element the SDK no longer renders).
- `feat(community-app): add rail create-channel affordance for admins` (`anentrypoint-design` c91abd2) + `fix(a11y): fix focus-race on modal/dialog/menu/lightbox open` (3bff8bf) + `fix(voice): shrink PTT button on height-constrained (landscape) viewports` (bb5e03f) — SDK-side changes: a real create-channel button gated on `canManage`; six overlay types (SettingsPopover/EmojiPicker/Popover/ContextMenu/Drawer/Dialog/VideoLightbox) had a `queueMicrotask` focus race that silently broke Escape-to-close for keyboard users, live-witnessed via a manually-focused popover before the fix; the PTT button clipped off-screen at phone-landscape heights (667x320).
- `feat(pages): make the Pages feature reachable — create + real edit modal` (b4f728e) — Pages were fully built at the protocol level (kind 30078, real publish/delete) but had zero UI path to create one; added "Create Page" to the server context menu and a proper edit modal replacing a crude `window.prompt()`.
- `fix(a11y): remove hidden file input from tab order` (ecb2569) — the hidden `#fileInput` was the very first Tab-focusable element on the page.

## [2026-07-26] Fix voice-join requiring a mic, and dead mobile drawer/member-panel toggles

- `fix(voice+mobile): join voice without a mic, open mobile drawer + member panel` (b9c5163) — two real, live-witnessed regressions found during a full-app audit prompted by "get it to actually function": (1) `voice.js`'s `connect()` threw hard on any `getUserMedia` failure with no listen-only fallback, even though every downstream `localStream` use already null-guards it, so anyone without a working mic (including this session's own headless-browser witness) could never join voice at all; (2) the mobile hamburger menu and member-list toggle buttons flipped classes on dead legacy scaffold elements instead of the `mobileMenuOpen`/`memberListOpen` signals the SDK's `mountCommunityApp` actually reads (confirmed by decompiling the live `247420.js` bundle), so on mobile neither the room rail nor the member panel could ever open despite the buttons visually responding to taps. Verified live on both a local server and the production GH Pages deploy: voice now joins listen-only with a toast, mobile drawer/member panel both open and close correctly, chat send/receive/delete/reply and desktop rendering all re-verified with zero regressions.

## [2026-07-24] Fix mobile triple-header chrome stack

- `fix(mobile): hide redundant app-topbar nav on narrow phones to reclaim vertical space` (b144c12) — three stacked SDK header rows consumed ~40% of a typical phone viewport before any content; hid the redundant home/servers/source nav row below 480px (still reachable via the hamburger drawer), shrinking the topbar 96px->56px.

## [2026-07-24] Fix bans never enforced in text chat (voice-only until now)

- `fix(chat): enforce bans/timeouts in text chat, not just voice` (c6edc4f/18c87e2) — bans.isBanned()/isTimedOut() were only ever consulted by voice.js. A banned user could send text messages freely, and their messages were never filtered from anyone's view. Fixed with send-time rejection plus receive-side filtering, verified live (simulated self-ban blocks sending with a real toast; normal sending unaffected).

## [2026-07-24] Comprehensive audit: fix message deletion never propagating

- `fix(chat): propagate message deletions to other clients (NIP-09 kind:5)` (14fe3ff) — found during a full-app audit prompted by "consider every aspect": no code anywhere subscribed to kind:5 deletion events, so a deleted message stayed visible for everyone except the person who deleted it. Fixed with the same authorization pattern already proven correct in the roles/bans/settings/pages stores. Also re-verified: relay reconnect banner, error surfacing for network/auth/voice failures, empty states across member list/thread panel/forum, voice control accessibility, and dead-code cleanup status -- all found solid, no further gaps.

## [2026-07-24] Fix voice grid never rendering participants (regression since SDK migration)

- `fix(voice): seed voiceParticipants on connect so the voice grid actually renders anyone` (ab7cdc0) — the actual bug behind the user's "voice used to work, broken since the redesign" report: `state.voiceParticipants` was only ever populated by a `'participants'` event that never fires for a self-only join, so the voice grid rendered zero tiles even on a fully successful connection. Verified live with a real (fake-device) getUserMedia + WebRTC mesh connect.

## [2026-07-24] Fix reported layout/completeness bugs

- `fix(layout): close 8px chat-composer/status-bar overlap on mobile; remove dead legacy topbar wiring` (7b39129) — closed an 8px overlap between the composer and fixed status bar on mobile viewports; removed `ui-shell.js` `wireCrumb()` logic believed dead at the time.
- `fix(html+state): correct premature .app-div close reparenting legacy overlays to body; restore live status footer; clear composer on send` (50c2556) — the real root cause of the reported "incomplete GUI": a stray extra `</div>` in `docs/nostr-chat/index.html` closed `.app-body`/`.app` one tag early, reparenting the status footer (and thread-panel/member-list) to be direct children of `<body>` instead of the hidden legacy scaffold, so it rendered permanently-frozen placeholder text. Fixed the nesting, moved the footer to a standalone element, restored its live-update wiring (correcting the prior session's mistaken belief it was dead code), and fixed the chat composer not clearing after Enter-to-send.

## [2026-04-13] loading-ux-server-pages
- index.html: Default user panel text changed from 'Not logged in' to 'Connecting...' — eliminates flash before scripts load.
- nostr-pages.js: Admin-publishable server pages. kind 30078 events (zellous-page:<serverId>:<slug>). HTML sanitized (removes script/iframe/on* attrs). Admin-only via serverRoles.isAdmin(). window.__debug.pages exposes loaded pages.
- ui-channels.js: Pages section in channel sidebar (below channels). Clicking page sets currentChannel to type:page and renders pageView.
- nostr-servers.js: switchTo() calls serverPages.subscribe(serverId).
- discord.css: page-view-header, page-view-body, page-editor, page-tb-btn styles.
- index.html: pageView div added; nostr-pages.js in script load list; __debug.pages wired.

## [2026-04-13] admin-ux-full
- ui-voice.js: Role badge overlay on voice tiles. Reads serverRoles.getRole() per participant pubkey; shows Owner/Admin/Mod badge with color.
- ui-chat.js: Announcement messages rendered with announcement-msg CSS class (gold left-border, tinted bg). announceBtn show/hide based on serverRoles.isAdmin() on every render cycle.
- nostr-chat.js: sendAnnouncement() sends kind 42 with ['t','announcement'] tag. _eventToMsg() extracts t-tags into msg.tags array.
- moderation.js: Kick from Voice menu item in Nostr mode when peer is in nostrVoice._peers. Closes peer locally and publishes best-effort kick signal (kind 30078 zellous-kick:<pubkey>).
- discord.css: .announcement-msg and .voice-tile-role-badge styles added.
- index.html: announceBtn added to chat input bar (hidden by default, shown to admins).
- app.js: announceBtn click handler wired to chat.sendAnnouncement().

## [2026-04-13] nostr-admin-roles-video-media
- nostr-roles.js: Nostr-native role system (kind 30078 zellous-roles:<serverId>). Only server creator can assign admin; admins can assign moderator. All clients verify event.pubkey === serverId creator before applying. window.__debug.roles exposes live store.
- nostr-settings.js: Server-owner/admin configurable Opus bitrate (8/16/24/48/96 kbps) stored as kind 30078 zellous-settings:<serverId>. Applied to AudioEncoder on voice connect and on change. Non-authorized events silently ignored.
- nostr-voice-camera.js: Real WebRTC camera toggle. Injects video track into existing peer connections via addTrack/replaceTrack. Disconnects cleanly on voice leave.
- nostr-voice-rtc.js: Handle remote video ontrack — create <video> element per peer, wire to participant hasVideo flag.
- nostr-media.js: NIP-96 media upload (nostr.build, void.cat). sendMedia() uploads file and publishes kind 42 with imeta tag. window.__debug.media exposes server list.
- nostr-chat.js: sendImage() wired to nostrMedia.sendMedia. linkify() renders inline image/video from URLs in messages. Paste-from-clipboard support in index.html.
- moderation.js: showMemberMenu gates role options on serverRoles.isAdmin(). Owner-only admin assignment enforced. Nostr mode calls serverRoles.setRole() instead of REST API.
- nostr-servers-ui.js: Bitrate selector added to edit modal for owner/admin; saved via serverSettings.setBitrate() on submit.
- state.js: Added cameraEnabled signal.
- index.html: Added nostr-roles/nostr-settings/nostr-media/nostr-voice-camera to load list. Camera button wired. Paste handler for clipboard images.

## [2026-04-12] perfect-negotiation-pattern
- Replace signalingState-guarded offer handler with RFC 8840 perfect negotiation pattern
- polite peer (myPubkey < peerPubkey): rolls back own offer on collision via setLocalDescription({type:'rollback'}) then chains doAnswer
- impolite peer: silently ignores colliding offers (early return), preventing deadlock
- Extract doAnswer() local fn: setRemoteDescription → drainBuf → transceiver setup → createAnswer → setLocalDescription → publishSignal (called from both stable and rollback paths, no duplication)

## [2026-04-12] sfu-hub-death-recovery
- In onconnectionstatechange closed handler: detect hub loss via nostrVoiceSfu._hub===peerPubkey, call _dissolve() immediately, schedule _maybeElect() at 500ms
- Add _hubLostAt timestamp field to nostrVoiceSfu, set on every _dissolve() call
- Expose hubLostAt in nostrVoiceSfu.__debug for observability of hub loss events

## [2026-04-12] peer-retry-unlimited
- Replace failCount<=1 ICE restart cap with exponential backoff up to 6 attempts then give up
- Add scheduleReconnect(pk, attempt): delay=min(2^attempt*2000,30000)ms, skips if attempt>=6
- Add cancelReconnect(pk): clears timer and removes from __voiceRetrySchedule
- cancelReconnect called in maybeConnect entry (presence event cancels pending retry)
- cancelReconnect + failCount reset on connectionState=connected
- window.__voiceRetrySchedule tracks all pending retries; exposed via window.__debug.voice.retrySchedule

## [2026-04-12] peer-track-ended-recovery
- Attach track.onended handler in ontrack: triggers doIceRestart if FSM=connected
- Add 5s stall interval per peer: detects all-ended srcObject tracks while FSM=connected, triggers doIceRestart once via trackEndedRestart flag
- Clear _stallInterval in _closePeer to prevent leaks on deliberate disconnect
- Log recovery events to window.__debug keyed by peer pubkey prefix

## [2026-04-12] debug-voice-registry
- Enhance nostrVoice.__debug getter: per-peer audioState, trackState, fsmState, retryAttempt, retryAt, retrySchedule fields
- Register window.__debug as live getter object: voice → nostrVoice.__debug, net → window.__debugNet (no page refresh needed)

## 2026-04-12
- Fix presence TTL 90s→300s preventing users from appearing (nostr-voice.js)
- Upsert participant tile on WebRTC connected state (nostr-voice-rtc.js)

## [2026-04-12] sfu-mesh-rtt-optimizations
- Add nostr-voice-sfu.js: dynamic hub election via RTT matrix, replaceTrack forwarding (no decode), dissolves mesh→star at 3+ peers, reverts to mesh at <3 peers
- nostr-voice-rtc.js: playoutDelayHint=0.02 on receivers, maxBitrate=48kbps on senders, audio hints applied on connected and ontrack
- nostr-voice.js: RTT scores carried in heartbeat presence events, SFU start/stop hooked to connect/disconnect, __debug exposes SFU state
- nostr-network.js: relay latency scoring (reqSentAt→first EVENT), window.__debugNet exposes relay latencies, condensed to 159L
- nostr-voice-sfu.js: window.nostrVoiceSfu.__debug exposes mode/hub/rttMatrix

## [2026-04-12] context-menus-servers-invites-mobile
- Right-click server icon shows context menu: Copy Invite Link, Edit Server (owner), Leave Server, Delete Server (owner)
- Split nostr-servers.js UI methods into nostr-servers-ui.js (mirrors nostr-channels-ui.js pattern)
- Server invite URL: location.origin + ?room=serverId, copies to clipboard with toast
- ?room= param now shows preview modal (Join Server?) before joining, fetches server name from Nostr
- Edit Server modal for owners: rename + recolor, republishes kind 34550 event
- Mobile: server list becomes fixed bottom horizontal bar with env(safe-area-inset-bottom) padding
- Mobile: channel sidebar slides from left, clears bottom server bar area
- Mobile: chat input sticky bottom, min-height 44px touch targets on all interactive elements
- Mobile: voice controls enlarged (56px buttons), context menu items 44px touch height

## [2026-04-12] voice-channel-click
- Clicking a voice channel immediately calls lk.connect() — no separate join button
- Clicking the active voice channel calls lk.disconnect()
- Channel item shows spinner animation during connecting state
- Removed "Click to join voice channel" overlay from voice view grid

## [2026-04-12] remove-self-hosted
- Deleted server/ directory (all server-side modules)
- Deleted lib/ directory (server SDK wrappers)
- Deleted server.js, livekit.yaml, nixpacks.toml, nodemon.json, keep-alive.sh
- Deleted server-mode-only js files: network.js, auth.js, auth-account.js, network-handlers.js, network-media.js, api.js, channels-api.js, channels-ui.js, chat.js, livekit.js, servers.js, servers-ui.js, ui-helpers.js
- Removed server deps from package.json: busybase, cors, express, livekit-server-sdk, ws, msgpackr
- docs/nostr-chat still works — all script imports verified present

## [2026-04-12] redesign-css
- Replace Discord-clone CSS with original minimal dark design

- Added audioEncoder and audioDecoders to state (17 properties total)
- Updated audio module with initEncoder() and createDecoder() methods
- Modified setupRecording() to use AudioEncoder with AudioData format
- Modified handleChunk() to use AudioDecoder with EncodedAudioChunk
- Updated replay() to use dedicated AudioDecoder for stored Opus audio

### Technical
- Uses native browser WebCodecs API (no external dependencies)
- Opus encoding/decoding in separate threads (non-blocking)
- Per-user decoder instances for concurrent playback
- Automatic decoder initialization on speaker_joined
- Replay creates synthetic decoder IDs for historical audio
